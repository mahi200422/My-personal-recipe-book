          <h3>Instructions:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>**Prepare the Dough:** In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and salt. Gradually add the water,<br> mixing until a shaggy dough forms. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5-7 minutes,<br> or until smooth and elastic. Add a little more water if the dough is too dry. Divide the dough into 2-3 portions, cover with a damp cloth,<br> and let rest for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>**Prepare the Filling:** While the dough rests, heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat.<br> Add the finely chopped leeks and cook until they are very soft and translucent, about 15-20 minutes. Stir in<br> the dried mint, red pepper flakes (if using), salt, and black pepper. Let cool slightly.</li>
            <li>**Prepare the Yogurt Sauce:** In a bowl, combine the plain yogurt, minced garlic, dried mint, and salt.<br> Mix well and set aside.</li>

            <li>**Assemble the Aushak:** On a lightly floured surface, roll out one portion of the dough very thinly into<br> a large circle. Using a knife or pizza cutter, cut the circle into 2-inch squares. Place a small spoonful of<br> the leek filling in the center of each square. Bring the opposite corners of each square together to form a triangle and pinch the edges to seal.<br> You can also bring all four corners together and pinch to seal. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.</li>
            <li>**Cook the Aushak:** Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Gently drop the aushak into the boiling water,<br> a few at a time, being careful not to overcrowd the pot. Cook for 5-7 minutes, or until the<br> dumplings float to the surface and are cooked through.</li>
            <li>**Serve the Aushak:** Using a slotted spoon, remove the cooked aushak from the water and arrange them on a serving platter.<br> Spoon the garlic yogurt sauce generously over the dumplings, and then top with the warm tomato topping.</li>

            </li>
            <li>For the Egg Wash (optional):
              <ul>
                <li>Egg yolk: 1</li>
                <li>Milk or water: 1 tablespoon</li>

        <div>
          <h3>Instructions:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Make the Crust:</b> In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, and salt.<br> Cut in the cold butter using a pastry blender or your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.<br> Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, mixing until the dough just comes together.<br> Be careful not to overmix.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough in half (one slightly larger than the other for the bottom crust).<br> Form each half into a disc, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li><b>Make the Filling:</b> In a large bowl, combine the sliced apples, sugar, flour or<br> cornstarch, cinnamon, nutmeg (if using), and lemon juice.</li>
            <li><b>Assemble the Pie:</b> Preheat oven to 350¬∞F (175¬∞C).</li>
            <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll out the larger disc of dough to a 12-inch circle.<br> Carefully transfer the dough to a 9-inch pie plate. Trim the edges, leaving a 1/2-inch overhang.</li>
            <li>Pour the apple filling into the pie crust. Dot with small pieces of butter (if using).</li>
            <li>Roll out the remaining dough to an 11-inch circle. Place the dough over the filling.<br> Trim the edges, leaving a 1-inch overhang. Crimp the top and bottom crust edges together to seal. <br>Cut several slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.</li>
            <li><b>Bake:</b> If desired, brush the top crust with the egg wash (egg yolk mixed with milk or water)<br> and sprinkle with coarse sugar.</li>
            <li>Bake for 45-60 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly. If the crust<br> starts to brown too quickly, you can loosely tent the pie with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Let the pie cool on a wire rack for at least 2-3 hours before slicing and serving.</li>

          <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>2 cups heavy cream (halal)</li>
            <li>4 large egg yolks (halal)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>Pinch of salt</li>
            <li>Optional for Chocolate Pot de Cr√®me: 2 ounces halal dark chocolate, melted</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="instructions">
          <h3>Instructions:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 325¬∞F (160¬∞C).</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, sugar, and salt until pale and slightly thickened.</li>
            <li>In a saucepan, heat the heavy cream over medium heat until it is just simmering around the edges. Do not boil.</li>
            <li>Gradually whisk the warm cream into the egg yolk mixture, a little at a time, to temper the eggs. Stir in <br>the vanilla extract (and melted chocolate if making chocolate pot de cr√®me).</li>
            <li>Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl to ensure a smooth texture.</li>
            <li>Pour the custard into small ramekins or custard cups.</li>
            <li>Place the ramekins in a baking dish and pour hot water into the dish until it reaches about halfway up <br>the sides of the ramekins (this creates a water bath).</li>
            <li>Bake for 25-35 minutes, or until the edges of the custard are set but the centers are still slightly jiggly.</li>
            <li>Carefully remove the baking dish from the oven and let the ramekins cool in the water bath for about 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer the ramekins to the refrigerator and chill for at least 2 hours, or preferably overnight, until completely set.</li>
            <li>Serve chilled. You can garnish with whipped cream (halal), fresh berries, or a dusting of cocoa powder if desired.</li>

            <li>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, whisking constantly until the batter is smooth and lump-free.</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes (or up to 2 hours) to allow the batter to rest.<br> This helps the gluten relax, resulting in more tender crepes.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly buttered non-stick skillet or crepe pan over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the hot skillet, tilting the pan quickly to spread the batter evenly into a thin circle.</li>
            <li>Cook for 1-2 minutes, or until the edges of the crepe are lightly golden and the top appears set.</li>
            <li>Carefully flip the crepe with a thin spatula and cook for another 30-60 seconds until lightly golden on the other side.</li>
            <li>Transfer the cooked crepe to a plate and keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, buttering the pan as needed.</li>
            <li>Serve the crepes warm with your favorite fillings, such as fruit, whipped cream, chocolate spread, or powdered sugar.</li>

        <h2>Lemonade</h2>
        <img src="images\LEMONADE.jpg" alt="Image of Lemonade" width="700">
        <div>
          <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Fresh lemons: 6-8 (depending on size)</li>
            <li>Water: 6-8 cups (adjust to taste)</li>
            <li>Sweetener (such as sugar, honey, agave syrup): 3/4 - 1 cup (adjust to taste)</li>
            <li>Optional: Mint sprigs, lemon slices, or ice for serving</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Instructions:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Wash the lemons thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Squeeze the juice from the lemons. You should get about 1 to 1.5 cups of lemon juice. Remove any seeds.</li>
            <li><b>Make a Simple Syrup (optional, but recommended for granulated sugar):</b> In a saucepan, combine the<br> sweetener (if using granulated sugar) with 1 cup of water. Heat over medium heat, stirring until the sweetener is completely dissolved.<br> Remove from heat and let it cool slightly. If using honey or agave, you can skip this step and mix it directly with the lemon juice and water.</li>
            <li>In a large pitcher, combine the fresh lemon juice, the simple syrup (if made), and the remaining water.<br> Start with 6 cups of water and adjust to your preferred strength.</li>
            <li>Stir well to ensure everything is thoroughly mixed.</li>
            <li>Taste the lemonade and add more sweetener or water as needed to achieve your desired balance of sweetness<br> and tartness.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld and the lemonade to chill.</li>
            <li>Serve cold with ice and garnish with mint sprigs or lemon slices, if desired.</li>

        <h2>Mallow Flower Syrup</h2>
        <img src="images\Mallow syrup.jpg" alt="Image of Mallow Flower Syrup" width="700">
        <div>
          <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Fresh mallow flowers (Malva sylvestris): 2 cups (loosely packed, petals only)</li>
            <li>Water: 2 cups</li>
            <li>Sweetener (such as sugar or honey): 1 cup (adjust to taste)</li>
            <li>Lemon juice: 1-2 tablespoons (helps preserve color and adds a touch of tartness)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Instructions:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Gently rinse the mallow flowers under cool water to remove any dirt or insects. Pat them dry.<br> Use only the petals, removing any green parts.</li>
            <li>In a saucepan, bring the water to a boil.</li>
            <li>Once boiling, remove the saucepan from the heat and add the mallow flower petals.</li>
            <li>Stir gently to ensure all the petals are submerged.</li>
            <li>Cover the saucepan and let the flowers steep in the hot water for at least 4-6 hours,<br> or preferably overnight, at room temperature.<br> This will allow the water to extract the color and flavor from the flowers. The liquid should turn a beautiful shade of blue or purple.</li>
            <li>Strain the liquid through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth into a clean saucepan,<br> discarding the spent flower petals.</li>
            <li>Add the sweetener (sugar or honey) to the strained liquid.</li>
            <li>Heat the saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly until the sweetener is completely dissolved.</li>
            <li>Once the sweetener is dissolved, bring the syrup to a gentle simmer. Simmer for about 5-10 minutes,<br> allowing it to thicken slightly. Be careful not to boil it vigorously.</li>
            <li>Stir in the lemon juice. The color of the syrup might change slightly to a more vibrant pink or purple<br> depending on the pH.</li>
            <li>Remove the saucepan from the heat and let the mallow flower syrup cool completely.</li>
            <li>Pour the cooled syrup into a clean, airtight bottle or jar. Store it in the refrigerator.<br> It should last for several weeks.</li>
            <li>Use the syrup to flavor drinks, desserts, or other culinary creations. You can mix it with water<br> or sparkling water for a refreshing drink.</li>

        <h2>Cherry Juice</h2>
        <img src="images\CHERRY syrup.jpg" alt="Image of Cherry Juice" width="700">
        <div>
          <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Fresh cherries: 2 pounds (pitted)</li>
            <li>Water: 1 cup (adjust to desired consistency)</li>
            <li>Sweetener (such as sugar, honey, or maple syrup): to taste (optional)</li>
            <li>Lemon juice: 1 tablespoon (optional, to enhance color and flavor)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Instructions:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Wash the fresh cherries thoroughly and remove the pits.</li>
            <li>Place the pitted cherries in a saucepan. Add the water. The amount of water will affect the thickness of the juice.<br> For a thicker juice, use less water.</li>
            <li>Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat. Once simmering, reduce the heat to low and cook for about 15-20 minutes,<br> or until the cherries are soft and have released their juice.</li>
            <li>Remove the saucepan from the heat and let the mixture cool slightly.</li>
            <li>Strain the cherry mixture through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth into a clean bowl or jar. Use the back of a spoon to press down<br> on the solids to extract as much juice as possible. Discard the solids.</li>
            <li>Taste the juice and add sweetener (if using) according to your preference. Stir until the sweetener is dissolved.</li>
            <li>Stir in the lemon juice (if using).</li>
            <li>Let the cherry juice cool completely.</li>
            <li>Pour the juice into a clean bottle or container and store it in the refrigerator. It will keep for about 3-4 days.</li>
            <li>Serve chilled. You can dilute it with more water or sparkling water if desired.</li>
